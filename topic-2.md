# Topic 2  
## Fundamentals of Immunology

- Immune system overview
- Immunoglobulins
- Lymphocytes

---

# Learning objectives

- Understand immune system components
- Classify immunoglobulins
- Describe lymphocyte types & functions

---

# Immune system overview

- **Innate immunity**
- **Adaptive immunity**
- Humoral vs cellular responses

---

# Innate immunity

- Physical barriers
- Neutrophils, macrophages
- NK cells
- Complement

*Fast, non-specific*

---

# Adaptive immunity

- Antigen-specific
- Memory formation
- Slower onset

- **B cells**
- **T cells**

---

# Immunoglobulins – classes

- **IgG**
- **IgA**
- **IgM**
- **IgE**
- **IgD**

---

# Immunoglobulins – functions

- IgG: opsonization, placental transfer
- IgA: mucosal immunity
- IgM: primary response
- IgE: allergy, parasites
- IgD: B-cell regulation

---

# B lymphocytes

- Antibody production
- Class switching
- Memory B cells
- Plasma cells

---

# T lymphocytes

- **CD4+** helper T cells
- **CD8+** cytotoxic T cells
- Regulatory T cells

---

# T helper subsets

- **Th1** – intracellular pathogens
- **Th2** – allergy, IgE
- **Th17** – inflammation
- **Treg** – immune tolerance

---

# Summary

- Innate vs adaptive immunity
- Immunoglobulin diversity
- Lymphocyte specialization
