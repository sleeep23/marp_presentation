# Topic 4  
## Allergic Rhinitis

- Etiology
- Pathogenesis
- Clinical features
- Diagnosis
- Treatment principles

---

# Definition & importance

**Allergic rhinitis**
- IgE-mediated inflammation of nasal mucosa
- Triggered by allergen exposure

**Clinical relevance**
- Strong association with asthma
- Significant impact on quality of life

---

# Etiology

- **Inhalant allergens**
  - House dust mite
  - Pollens
  - Animal dander
  - Molds

- Genetic predisposition (atopy)
- Environmental exposure

---

# Pathogenesis (overview)

- Allergen exposure → **Th2 response**
- IL-4 / IL-13 → IgE production
- IgE binds mast cells
- Re-exposure → mediator release

→ Nasal inflammation

---

# Pathogenesis (phases)

## Early phase (minutes)
- Histamine release
- Sneezing
- Rhinorrhea
- Nasal itching

## Late phase (hours)
- Eosinophilic inflammation
- Nasal congestion

---

# Clinical features

- Sneezing
- Watery rhinorrhea
- Nasal obstruction
- Nasal / ocular itching

**Associated**
- Allergic conjunctivitis
- Sinus symptoms

---

# Classification

- **Seasonal** (pollens)
- **Perennial** (dust mites, pets)
- **Intermittent vs persistent**
- **Mild vs moderate–severe**

---

# Diagnosis

## Clinical
- Typical symptoms
- Allergen exposure history

## In vivo
- Skin prick test

## In vitro
- Specific IgE

> Diagnosis = symptoms + sensitization

---

# Treatment – principles

1. Allergen avoidance
2. Pharmacotherapy
3. Immunotherapy (selected cases)

---

# Treatment – drugs

- **Intranasal corticosteroids** (first-line)
- Oral / intranasal antihistamines
- Leukotriene receptor antagonists
- Short-term decongestants (caution)

---

# Summary

- IgE-mediated nasal inflammation
- Early + late phase response
- Intranasal steroids = cornerstone
- Evaluate asthma comorbidity
