# Topic 6  
## Urticaria & Atopic Dermatitis

- Etiology
- Pathogenesis
- Clinical features
- Diagnosis
- Treatment principles

---

# Urticaria – definition

**Urticaria (hives)**
- Transient, pruritic wheals
- Dermal edema due to mast cell mediator release
- Individual lesion lasts < 24 h

± **Angioedema** (deeper swelling)

---

# Urticaria – etiology

- **Immunologic**
  - IgE-mediated allergy
- **Non-immunologic**
  - Drugs (NSAIDs)
  - Physical stimuli (cold, pressure)
- **Chronic spontaneous**
  - Often idiopathic / autoimmune

---

# Urticaria – pathogenesis

- Mast cell activation
- Histamine release
- Increased vascular permeability
- Dermal edema → wheal formation

Key mediator: **histamine**

---

# Urticaria – clinical features

- Wheals with erythematous border
- Intense pruritus
- Migratory lesions
- Angioedema: lips, eyelids, airway

---

# Urticaria – diagnosis

- Clinical diagnosis
- History focused on:
  - Duration (< 6 weeks vs ≥ 6 weeks)
  - Triggers
- Extensive testing usually unnecessary

---

# Urticaria – treatment

- **First-line**
  - Non-sedating H1 antihistamines
- Dose escalation if needed
- Short-course systemic steroids (severe cases)

Avoid known triggers

---

# Atopic dermatitis – definition

- Chronic inflammatory skin disease
- Strongly associated with **atopy**
- Impaired skin barrier + immune dysregulation

Common in childhood, may persist

---

# Atopic dermatitis – pathogenesis

- Skin barrier dysfunction (filaggrin defect)
- Th2-dominant inflammation
- Increased IgE production
- Environmental allergen penetration

---

# Atopic dermatitis – clinical features

- Severe pruritus
- Eczematous lesions
- Age-dependent distribution
  - Infants: face, extensor surfaces
  - Children/adults: flexural areas

---

# Atopic dermatitis – treatment

- Skin hydration (emollients)
- Topical corticosteroids
- Topical calcineurin inhibitors
- Control infections & triggers
