# Topic 7  
## Drug Allergy

- Etiology
- Pathogenesis
- Clinical manifestations
- Diagnosis
- Treatment principles

---

# Definition

**Drug allergy**
- Immunologically mediated adverse drug reaction
- Distinct from dose-related toxicity or side effects

Unpredictable, may be severe

---

# Etiology

- Antibiotics (β-lactams)
- NSAIDs
- Anticonvulsants
- Contrast media

Risk factors:
- Previous exposure
- Genetic predisposition

---

# Pathogenesis

- Drug acts as **hapten**
- Binds host protein → antigen formation
- Immune activation

Possible mechanisms:
- Type I–IV hypersensitivity

---

# Clinical manifestations

- Type I: urticaria, anaphylaxis
- Type II: cytopenia
- Type III: serum sickness
- Type IV: maculopapular rash, SJS/TEN

---

# Severe cutaneous adverse reactions

- Stevens–Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- DRESS syndrome

→ High morbidity & mortality

---

# Diagnosis

- Detailed drug history
- Timing of exposure vs symptoms
- Skin tests (selected drugs)
- In vitro tests (limited role)

Provocation: **last resort**

---

# Management – acute

- Immediate drug discontinuation
- Symptomatic treatment
- Epinephrine if anaphylaxis
- Supportive care for severe reactions

---

# Long-term management

- Avoid culprit drug
- Cross-reactivity assessment
- Patient education
- Drug allergy documentation

---

# Prevention

- Avoid unnecessary drug exposure
- Cautious re-challenge
- Allergy labeling accuracy

---

# Summary

- Immune-mediated ADR
- Wide clinical spectrum
- History is key diagnostic tool
- Prevention is critical
