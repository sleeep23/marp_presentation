# Topic 1  
## History of Allergology & Allergic Reactions

- Historical development of allergology  
- Conceptual framework of allergic reactions  
- Diagnostic approaches: in vivo vs in vitro  
- Indications and safety considerations  

---

# Background & scope

- Allergic diseases are heterogeneous  
- A shared framework is needed to compare diseases across topics  
- This section sets the conceptual baseline used in later analysis  

---

# Historical development (summary)

- 1906: “Allergy” introduced (von Pirquet)  
- Early phase: observation-driven discipline  
- 1960s: discovery of IgE  
- 1980s–1990s: standardized diagnostic tests  
- Recent era: molecular diagnostics & biologics  

---

# Key conceptual terms

- Allergen  
- Sensitization  
- Clinical allergy  
- Atopy  
- Anaphylaxis

# Framework of allergic reactions

**Gell & Coombs classification**
- Type I – IgE-mediated  
- Type II – antibody-mediated cytotoxicity  
- Type III – immune complex–mediated  
- Type IV – T-cell–mediated  

---

# Type I hypersensitivity

- Central mechanism in many allergic diseases  
- IgE-dependent mast cell activation  
- Rapid onset after exposure

---

# Type II and Type III reactions

**Type II**
- Antibody-mediated injury to target cells  

**Type III**
- Immune complex deposition  
- Secondary inflammatory response  

(These are often discussed in the context of drug-related reactions.)

---

# Type IV hypersensitivity

- T-cell–mediated immune response  
- Delayed onset (48–72 hours)  

Representative example:
- Allergic contact dermatitis  

---

# Diagnostic approaches

**In vivo**
- Skin prick test  
- Intradermal test  
- Patch test  

**In vitro**
- Total IgE  
- Specific IgE  
- Component-resolved diagnostics

# Indications & safety considerations

- Testing should be clinically justified  
- Increased risk in:
  - uncontrolled asthma  
  - recent severe systemic reactions  
- Diagnostic yield must be balanced with patient safety
