# Topic 9  
## Molecular Allergology & Immunotherapy

- Molecular allergology
- Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD)
- Specific immunotherapy (SIT)
- Allergy & Asthma School

---

# What is molecular allergology?

- Allergy diagnosis at **molecular (component) level**
- Uses **purified or recombinant allergens**
- Goes beyond whole-extract testing

→ Improves **risk assessment** and **precision medicine**

---

# Why molecular diagnosis matters

- Distinguish **true allergy vs cross-reactivity**
- Predict **severity of reactions**
- Guide **immunotherapy decisions**
- Reduce over-diagnosis

Example:
- Peanut sensitization ≠ high-risk peanut allergy

---

# Component-Resolved Diagnostics (CRD)

- Measures IgE against **specific allergen components**
- Performed via **in vitro testing**

Common examples:
- Food allergens
- Pollen allergens
- Insect venom components

---

# CRD – clinical interpretation

- **Primary sensitization**
  - Stable storage proteins
  - Higher risk of systemic reactions

- **Cross-reactive sensitization**
  - Panallergens (profilin, PR-10)
  - Often mild, local symptoms

→ Helps avoid unnecessary food avoidance

---

# Example: food allergy (conceptual)

- Whole allergen IgE: positive
- Component IgE:
  - Storage protein (+) → high-risk
  - PR-10 only (+) → oral allergy syndrome

Clinical decision changes based on **component profile**

---

# Specific Immunotherapy (SIT)

- Only **disease-modifying** treatment for allergy
- Repeated administration of allergen
- Induces immune tolerance

Used in:
- Allergic rhinitis
- Allergic asthma
- Insect venom allergy

---

# Types of immunotherapy

- **SCIT**
  - Subcutaneous
  - High efficacy
  - Higher risk of systemic reactions

- **SLIT**
  - Sublingual
  - Better safety profile
  - Requires adherence

---

# Mechanism of immunotherapy

- Immune deviation
  - ↓ Th2 response
  - ↑ Treg activity
- ↓ IgE
- ↑ IgG4 (blocking antibodies)
- Reduced mast cell/basophil reactivity

---

# Indications & contraindications

## Indications
- Confirmed IgE-mediated allergy
- Symptoms despite optimal pharmacotherapy
- Identifiable allergen

## Contraindications
- Uncontrolled asthma
- Severe immunodeficiency
- Active autoimmune disease
- Malignancy (relative)

---

# Allergy & Asthma School

- Structured patient education
- Disease understanding
- Trigger avoidance
- Proper medication use
- Self-management skills

→ Improves adherence & outcomes

---

# Summary

- Molecular allergology enables precision diagnosis
- CRD refines risk stratification
- SIT modifies disease course
- Education is essential for long-term control
