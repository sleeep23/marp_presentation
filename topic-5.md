# Topic 5  
## Bronchial Asthma

- Etiology
- Pathogenesis
- Clinical features
- Diagnosis
- Treatment principles

---

# Definition

**Bronchial asthma**
- Chronic inflammatory airway disease
- Variable, reversible airflow obstruction
- Airway hyperresponsiveness

---

# Etiology

- Genetic predisposition (atopy)
- Environmental triggers
  - Allergens
  - Viral infection
  - Exercise
  - Cold air
  - Irritants

---

# Pathogenesis (key concept)

- Chronic airway inflammation
- **Th2-driven immune response**
- Eosinophils, mast cells, cytokines
- Airway remodeling (chronic disease)

---

# Pathophysiology

- Bronchoconstriction
- Mucus hypersecretion
- Airway edema

→ Airflow limitation (reversible)

---

# Clinical features

- Wheezing
- Dyspnea
- Chest tightness
- Cough (often nocturnal / early morning)

Symptoms vary over time and intensity

---

# Diagnosis

## Clinical suspicion
- Episodic respiratory symptoms

## Pulmonary function test
- ↓ FEV₁
- ↓ FEV₁/FVC
- Reversibility (+)

---

# Monitoring tools

- Spirometry
- Peak flowmetry
- Symptom-based control assessment

---

# Treatment – goals

- Symptom control
- Prevent exacerbations
- Maintain normal activity
- Minimize side effects

---

# Treatment – stepwise approach

- **Controller**
  - Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
- **Reliever**
  - Short-acting β₂-agonist (SABA)

Additional:
- LABA (with ICS)
- LTRA
- Biologics (severe asthma)

---

# Summary

- Chronic inflammatory disease
- Reversible airflow obstruction
- ICS = cornerstone therapy
- Regular assessment & stepwise management
