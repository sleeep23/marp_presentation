# Topic 3  
## Respiratory Functional Examination

- FVD
- Spirometry
- Peak flowmetry
- Indications & contraindications

---

# Learning objectives

- Understand pulmonary function testing
- Describe spirometry parameters
- Interpret peak flowmetry
- Identify contraindications

---

# Why assess respiratory function?

- Diagnose obstructive lung disease
- Assess asthma severity
- Monitor treatment response
- Detect airflow limitation

---

# Forced Vital Capacity (FVD)

- Maximum volume exhaled after full inspiration
- Reflects lung volume & airway patency

**Key values**
- FVC
- FEV₁
- FEV₁/FVC ratio

---

# Spirometry – basic parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| FVC | Forced vital capacity |
| FEV₁ | Forced expiratory volume (1 sec) |
| FEV₁/FVC | Obstruction indicator |
| PEF | Peak expiratory flow |

---

# Spirometry – obstruction pattern

- ↓ FEV₁
- ↓ FEV₁/FVC
- FVC normal or ↓

**Typical diseases**
- Bronchial asthma
- COPD

---

# Bronchodilator reversibility test

- Baseline spirometry
- Short-acting β₂-agonist
- Repeat after 15 min

**Positive response**
- ↑ FEV₁ ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL

→ Suggests **asthma**

---

# Peak flowmetry

- Measures **PEF**
- Simple, portable
- Home monitoring tool

**Uses**
- Daily asthma monitoring
- Detect variability
- Early exacerbation detection

---

# Contraindications

## Absolute / relative
- Recent MI or stroke
- Uncontrolled asthma attack
- Pneumothorax
- Recent thoracic/abdominal surgery
- Severe respiratory distress

---

# Summary

- Spirometry = diagnostic tool
- Peak flowmetry = monitoring tool
- Reversibility = asthma clue
- Safety first in testing
