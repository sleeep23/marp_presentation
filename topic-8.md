# Topic 8  
## Acute Conditions in Allergology

- Anaphylaxis
- Quincke’s edema
- Status asthmaticus

---

# Anaphylaxis – definition

- Severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity
- Rapid onset
- Airway, breathing, circulation involvement

Most commonly **IgE-mediated**

---

# Anaphylaxis – triggers

- Foods
- Drugs
- Insect stings
- Latex

---

# Anaphylaxis – clinical features

- Skin: urticaria, flushing
- Respiratory: bronchospasm, laryngeal edema
- Cardiovascular: hypotension, shock
- GI: vomiting, diarrhea

---

# Anaphylaxis – management (core)

- **IM epinephrine (first-line)**
- Airway & oxygen
- IV fluids
- Adjuncts: antihistamines, steroids

Delay = ↑ mortality

---

# Quincke’s edema (angioedema)

- Localized deep tissue swelling
- Lips, eyelids, tongue, larynx
- With or without urticaria

Causes:
- Allergy
- ACE inhibitor
- Hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency

---

# Angioedema – management

- Airway assessment
- Epinephrine if allergic
- C1 inhibitor concentrate (hereditary)
- Avoid ACE inhibitors

---

# Status asthmaticus – definition

- Severe asthma exacerbation
- Poor response to standard therapy
- Life-threatening airflow obstruction

---

# Status asthmaticus – features

- Severe dyspnea
- Silent chest
- Hypoxemia
- Fatigue, altered mental status

---

# Status asthmaticus – treatment

- High-dose inhaled β₂-agonists
- Systemic corticosteroids
- Oxygen
- IV magnesium sulfate
- Mechanical ventilation if needed

---

# Summary

- Anaphylaxis → epinephrine first
- Angioedema → airway priority
- Status asthmaticus → aggressive escalation
